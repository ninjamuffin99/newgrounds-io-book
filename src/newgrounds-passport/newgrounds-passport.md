# Newgrounds Passport

Newgrounds Passport lets users log in (or sign up) to Newgrounds.com and Apps using Newgrounds.io. Logins from Newgrounds, Facebook and Google+ are all supported.

If you are using a pre-made library, consult it's documentation for how to get users logged in. Many of our libraries have wrappers that make using Newgrounds Passport very easy.
