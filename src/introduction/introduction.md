# Introduction

Newgrounds.io is an API built for indie game developers. It was originally designed for web-based games (specifically ones made in Adobe Flash), and has evolved over the years into the platform-agnostic version you see today.

Any developer can implement this API, absolutely free*, you just need a Newgrounds.com account, and a game project to get started (see [Getting Started](../getting_started/creating_a_game_project.md) section for details).

<small>*Future updates MAY introduce new/advanced features that will require a subscription. Who can tell what the future holds?</small>
