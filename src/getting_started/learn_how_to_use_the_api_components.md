# Learn how to use the API components

Newgrounds.io works by [sending messages to our API server](../communicating_with_the_server/communicating_with_the_server.md) that contain rules for executing components.

In programming terms, you can think of an API component as a remote function. These functions take parameters, execute, and return a result.

Consult the help documents for your library to learn how you can call a component, then check out the components list page to see what components are available to you.

If there is no library for your platform, you can [communicate with the server directly](../communicating_with_the_server/communicating_with_the_server.md).
